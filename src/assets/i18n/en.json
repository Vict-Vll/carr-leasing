Highly recommend Carrleasing!!",

We were fortunate enough to be connected to Daniel who was a great help in guiding us along through the process. We understood that he`s there to help and assist, not take advantage. He cared about us getting the best deal. Thank you Carrleasing!",
  "TESTIMONIAL3": "First time customer here. I always leased before directly from dealers and everyone knows what a pain that IS... well, no more, Carrleasing is here. They delivered exactly on time, and when they said they would. Right on the dot. All papers were ready when the dealer driver arrived and took 30 minutes to sign, then they showed me the car features. right after I got the keys. Documentation stated all amount exactly as what Daniel said it would be... love the car and love the leasing process even more.",
  "TESTIMONIAL4": "Daniel made me feel like I was his top priority during every interaction we had, unlike past experiences I`ve had before with car salesman. He promptly went over and beyond providing the information on the cars that I was considering to help me find the exact vehicle I was looking for within the budget had, so could make the decision easily from home. The car was even delivered to me at my office.",
